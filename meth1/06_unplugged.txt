Arrays Musical Chairs
Materials: Labels for chairs with numbers 0-5 one set of labels for each group. Labels for "temp" chairs (initially hidden from students).

Possible group activity. Group into teams of 4-5. Have each team write out resulting algorithm for each challenge below. 

Requested tools: extra chair to act as temporary variable

4-5 students sit in chairs around tables. Each chair labeled starting with 0.
Several empty chair stands off to the side.

Challenge#1: Swap #2 and 3. Only 1 person out of seat at a time. Option: demonstrate 1 group in front of class.
Challenge#2: Cycle through so that 0 sits in 1's seat, 1 sits in 2's seat, and the last person ends up in 0's seat. (Iterative swap).
Challenge#3: Insert a student into the list.
Challenge#4: Write an algorithm so that the odd numbers end up switched with the even numbers on either side. Teacher provides picture of what end result should look like.

Wrap Up: Groups demonstrate their algorithms. Groups compare their algorithms with other groups. Groups give each other feedback on their algorithms.
